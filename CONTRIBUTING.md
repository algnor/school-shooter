## Code style guidelines

Just use an EditorConfig plugin in your preferred text editor and things will
mostly be handled for you.

If you use the build-in editor in Godot, make sure to set the preferred
indentation to 4 spaces.

## Files

Follow the structure of `assets/` and `src/`, read the relevant READMEs for more
information.

All variable and asset names should use snake_case but all classes/scripts and
nodes/scenes should use PascalCase.
